# Editing Input Binds
???+ bug
    This function edits the input binds of the module but if the player has a high ping the changes may not be applied.
---

##Example
```lua
module.inputBind("CommandBar", "Q")
```
Now, we'll must be able to open and close the command bar with 'Q'. 

???+ tip
    You can check all `input methods` in the API documentation.
